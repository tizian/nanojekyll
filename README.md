# nanojekyll

This is a minimal replacement for the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator used to build my [personal website](https://tizianzeltner.com/).

This project has grown out of my increasing frustration with debugging obscure Ruby installation errors just to run Jekyll. This project is thus implemented in a single Python script *certified free from Ruby*.
